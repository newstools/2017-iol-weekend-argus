They were joined by Hip-Hop heads in a bid to exchange takkies with fellow enthusiasts at The Lookout, Granger Bay. Sneaker-heads showed up in their freshest pair of kicks ranging from Jordans, Nikes and Adidas amongst other brands. But, the platform also offered sneaker collectors and aficionados the opportunity to buy, sell or trade sneakers as well as buy locally produced apparel and footwear, creating the opportunity for small and emerging business. A variety of stalls offered old and new sneakers, at what has been described as the largest sneaker trading event in Africa. Organisers estimated an attendance of 2 500 people. One of the stand-out stalls and emerging small businesses was Hustle Cape Town in collaboration with Plain Flavoured. The stall not only stocked apparel and sneakers but also sneaker inspired art. Directly opposite was first Sneaker Exchange vendors Street Lines Apparel, a ladies only street style inspired clothing and footwear collection. Founder Nuraan Samsodien said it was their first time at the event and business was good. “The ladies at the event are happy that there is something for the females this time round, hopefully we will return. “Street Lines is very much for sneakers, so this is why we participated this time. The sneaker culture in Cape Town is growing, especially for ladies.” Sneaker bouquet Lace Up made a second appearance this year, boasting a wide selection of sleek takkies. MaHustle Originals, a local apparel line, drew a huge crowd at their stall with their unique vintage clothing line. Brand ambassador of MaHustle, Ollin Mazhambe, said what sets them apart from the rest of the other stalls was because their “brand makes limited collections unlike the rest.” Live entertainment from local artists Riky Rick, Anatii, Youngsta and Palmtree Paradise kept the vibe going.
