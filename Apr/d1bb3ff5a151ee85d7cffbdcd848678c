Wear them as a two-piece or mix and match them as separates. Pair the bottom with a quirky slogan T-shirt or denim shirt and the top with a fitted skirt or over a dress for a playful look. This look is also perfect for twinning with your bestie. Here Nontando Mposo wears a printed pyjama set from the Mr Price MRPxProject Collection and ankle boots from Woolworths. Heeled ankle boots are a must-have item that works for all seasons. Dressed up for a night out or worn to the office, they are versatile enough to add a pop of glam to any outfit.
