Dar es Salaam  – Tanzanian President John Magufuli on Friday fired almost 10 000 civil servants because they had forged their educational qualifications. Magufuli made the announcement on state television after an investigative task force found that 9 932 government workers presented fake qualifications when they were employed. The dismissed civil servants would have to defend themselves in court, the president said. "They are thieves like any other thieves. ... You cannot perform if you don't have deserving qualifications," said Magufuli. About 3 000 other civil servants were suspended while their certificates were being verified. The task force investigates the educational certificates of 435 000 civil servants throughout the East African nation. dpa
