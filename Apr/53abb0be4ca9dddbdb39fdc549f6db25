He said in papers filed in the Constitutional Court Mbeki had shown he was no expert in government systems by suggesting ANC MPs would be threatened or intimidated. “It is telling that in replying the applicant (the UDM) continues to seek refuge in statements made in social media platforms to make the unfounded allegation of intimidation. "There is no need for the court to take judicial notice of what ANC MP Dr Makhosi Khoza and former president Thabo Mbeki say or write in the media. It is neither factual or expert evidence,” said Zuma. “Mbeki is no expert on systems of government. Even if he was, his utterances cannot be turned into evidence for this court to consider. "To rely on these utterances is a desperate measure by the applicant to make a political case rather than a legal one,” said Zuma. Mbeki is one of the few senior ANC members calling for a secret ballot in the National Assembly. The former president penned a letter in The Star two weeks ago calling for ANC MPs to vote with their conscience. Mbeki’s spokesman, Mukoni Rathsitanga, could not be reached for comment yesterday. The Constitutional Court had set Friday as the deadline for all the parties to file their final heads of argument. Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng also indicated there could be further directives issued after the filing of the papers. Spokesman for the chief justice advocate Nathi Mncube said yesterday it was not prescribed when the justices of the court would meet to decide if there will be further directives to be issued. The Constitutional Court has 11 justices who will have to meet and peruse the documents submitted by all the parties. In her papers Speaker Baleka Mbete said the application by the UDM for a secret ballot has no basis in law. She said the Western Cape High Court had last November dismissed a similar application by Agang SA. The debate on the motion of no confidence in Zuma had been conducted without a secret ballot at that time. Political Bureau
