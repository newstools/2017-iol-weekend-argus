The meeting between the parties was the first since Zuma controversially reshuffled his cabinet, which resulted in the downgrading of the country’s economy to junk status. Zuma had called the meeting at the Sefako Makgatho Presidential Guest-house in Pretoria on Friday, ahead of the World Economic Forum Africa meeting in Durban. Dr Bongani Ngqulunga, Zuma’s spokesperson, said the nuclear build programme was among issues in the public domain that was generally of concern to business. On Wednesday, the Western Cape High Court found the proposed nuclear deal with Russia to be unlawful and unconstitutional and set it aside. Unperturbed, Ngqulunga said Zuma “reiterated” to the business leaders that the nuclear build programme would be “implemented at a scale and pace the country could afford”. The CEOs had also apparently raised concerns about possible economic policy changes in light of recent appointment of new ministers. The president made a commitment to convene another government-business session without much delay, said Ngqulunga. Political Bureau
