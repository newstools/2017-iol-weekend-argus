Lamoer and his co-accused, former police brigadiers Darius van der Ross, Kolindren Govender and his wife Logambal - also known as Sharon Govender - together with businessman Saleem Dawjee, face 109 charges of corruption, racketeering and money laundering involving about R1.6 million. Dawjee is the first accused, while Lamoer and the brigadiers are accused four to seven, respectively. The second and third defendants are Dawjee’s businesses, Towbars Cape CC and Towbars King CC. Lamoer’s lawyer, Grant Smith, questioned the State’s first witness, financial investigator Wynand Wessels, on how he analysed Lamoer’s finances. Smith presented Wessels with a preliminary report of the investigation in which Lamoer was the first to be reported on. He asked Wessels why he had focused on Lamoer and not on Dawjee, the first accused. Wessels said he started with Lamoer in the preliminary and in the final report presented to court because “he is the most senior” or “he is the big fish we want?”, Smith asked Wessels. Wessels denied targeting Lamoer, only saying he chose to structure his investigation to start with Lamoer. He said his mandate included checking bank statements, cheques and petrol slips. With regard to the first three defendants, his mandate was to check bank accounts and with the others to conduct lifestyle audits and analyse cash flow transactions, Wessels said. Smith also questioned Wessels on his qualifications in accounting and auditing and asked why the investigation had not been given to an outside auditing firm. “It seems the police wanted to save costs,” Smith asserted. The case continues on Tuesday.
