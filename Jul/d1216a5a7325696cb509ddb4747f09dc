CAPE TOWN - The Western Cape government’s video about texting and driving has gone viral, and drawing attention to one of the leading causes of crashes that result in serious injury and death on South African roads. As the United States’ National Safety Council points out, brain activity in the areas that process moving images decreases by over 33% when we are talking on our phone. This means that we effectively become partially blind when we use our cell-phone while driving. It’s due to this level of distraction that leads to the regular horrific collisions on our roads. As part of Safely Home efforts to curb distracted driving, the Western Cape government launched it’s #ItCanWait advertisement that highlights the dangers of being on your phone while driving. The video has, since being posted on Friday July14 and has gone viral, having been viewed locally over 800 000 times. The estimated global views on all online platforms as of mid-day on Tuesday was 36 000 000, mostly in the United Kingdom, with the ad also being featured on TV news all over the world.   #ItCanWait was a creative concept produced by the Western Cape Government’s agency, FCB. The video almost didn't make the cut however with Dube stating that the video went through rigorous testing through surveys and focus group. "It almost didn’t make the cut but the agency was very keen on the concept and offered to cover production costs as corporate social investment. After the final crash scene was added, retesting showed the clip had enormous viral potential which has certainly proven to be the case," he said." ADAPTED FROM PRESS RELEASE
