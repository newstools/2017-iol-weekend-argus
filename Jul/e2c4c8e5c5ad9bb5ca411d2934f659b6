The 71-year-old owner of Zhauns Business Opportunity Machines, was kidnapped in Woodstock on Tuesday at 5.30pm by three men who threatened him with a firearm. It is alleged that while Ahmed and his driver were packing items into his case, he was forced into a double cab bakkie that pulled up behind them. The bakkie then drove towards Victoria Road, where it was found abandoned. Ahmed, who started Zhauns, has been selling machines that manufacture toilet rolls, ice cream and popcorn and other items for the past 40 years. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said circumstances surrounding Ahmed's disappearance are still unknown and there are no further developments in the case. She could not confirm that there was a ransom demand, but said the investigation is continuing. However, family spokesperson Hanif Loonat said a call from Ahmed was received on Friday afternoon saying the kidnappers were demanding 
a ransom. Loonat did not want to disclose the amount demanded, but said Ahmed was distressed and under strain. “The family is currently assessing how they are going to respond,” he said. He said the situation was “very distressing” for the family. Added to the family’s concerns are speculations and conclusions that have been made on social media, said Loonat. “There have been irresponsible statements made on social media,” Loonat said. He said it was very distressing when people made false statements on social media. Woodstock Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Moosa Sydow said a kidnapping of this nature was a first for the area. “This is new for us and it is an unfortunate incident.” But Sydow is convinced there are more people who witnessed the crime. He is appealing for them to come forward. He said his thoughts and prayers were with the family and the CPF would continue to support the police during their investigation. *  Anyone with information can call crime stop on 086 0010 111.
