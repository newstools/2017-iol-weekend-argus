Pretoria Paul O Sullivan and his lawyer are set to approach the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in a bid to avoid premature arrests like the forensic consultant experienced on Monday night. O Sullivan was arrested outside AfriForum s offices in Pretoria and taken to Kameeldrift police station, where he was charged with fraud, intimidation and extortion. This was allegedly for impersonating a member of the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid).Late that night, his lawyers proceeded to the high court in Pretoria to seek an urgent order for his release, and to comply with an earlier order that, should they intend to detain him, give him 48 hours to present himself to a police station.Judge Francis Legodi ordered the matter be struck off the roll. He reserved judgment on who would pay costs. Right now we ll have to talk to the NPA and agree they approach investigations with more dignity and honour, said O Sullivan s lawyer Willie Spies. #PaulOSullivan arrested outside AfriForum offices O'Sullivan, assistant talk about arrests Hawks react with fury to O'Sullivan We do not have a problem with what they are doing, but it's a different story when they ambush and ill-treat our clients.
