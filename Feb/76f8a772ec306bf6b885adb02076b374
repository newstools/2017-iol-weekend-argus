Cape Town -&nbsp;The ANC in Parliament has called for the national legislature to lay criminal charges against the EFF for the assault of protection officers and damaging infrastructure during the brawl. ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu on Friday described the conduct of the EFF as a shame and national disgrace. Mthembu said the EFF must be charged criminally and Parliament institute disciplinary action against them. He said the behaviour of Julius Malema and his party was unwarranted and an orchestrated plan to disrupt President Jacob Zuma from delivering the State of the Nation Address. Mthembu said some of the staff from Parliament were injured during scuffles with the EFF, and a door to his office was damaged and several windows in Parliament damaged. He said serious action was needed against the EFF. The conduct of the EFF MPs last night, which involved blatant acts of criminality and intimidation, is the clearest indication yet that the party s resoluteness to render Parliament dysfunctional and subsequently destroy one of the most important institutions of the people, said Mthembu.Political Bureau
