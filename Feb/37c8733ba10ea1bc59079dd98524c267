Cape Town Another fire has broken out in the Western Cape, this time in the Witzenberg Municipality.On Sunday at about 10pm, a fire broke out near Bainskloof in Wellington.Traffic chief Kenny Africa said the fire was burning out of control, fanned by strong south-easterly winds. The fire has the potential to develop into a devastating fire and could pose a serious risk to farms, buildings and other structures. Firefighters have a major task on their hands to prevent damage to property and to fight the blaze, he said. Africa said the Cape Nature Reserve, Cape Winelands and Drakenstein fire services had been activated.Over the weekend, another fire broke out in the mountains surrounding Du Toitskloof Pass, causing a two-day road closure.Africa said fire-fighting teams managed to contain approximately 70% of the fire. More than 1 500ha of fynbos and other vegetation has been burnt. No serious injuries or structural damages were reported. The old Du Toitskloof Pass R101 was declared safe and reopened for traffic, he said. Meanwhile, the Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC, Anton Bredell, warned that the extreme weather conditions along the West Coast of the Western Cape had increased the risk of fire there. Unfortunately, conditions are such that the risk of a serious fire in the region is very high. We would like to call on travellers, visitors and people living on the West Coast to take extra care over the next few weeks to prevent fires as much as possible, said Bredell.Colin Deiner, the head of Disaster Management in the Western Cape said that areas along the Cape Peninsula and the Cape Winelands were fire-risk areas. The area is very dry and very hot and strong wind is prevalent. The season has been tough to date and we hope that the West Coast can remain as incident free as possible, he said. Bredell urged the public to report fires immediately and not to assume they had already been reported. Cape Argus
