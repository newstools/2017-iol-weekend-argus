Cape Town Former Springbok captain Joost van der Westhuizen is in a critical condition in hospital, the J9 Foundation has confirmed.The 45-year-old ex-scrumhalf has been fighting Motor Neurone Disease (MND) since 2011, and has in recent times required an oxygen tank on occasion to help him breathe. The family and friends of Joost ask that you all pray for Joost. He was taken to hospital earlier today and is in a critical condition, the foundation posted on Facebook on Saturday. We ask that you all please respect the family s time at the moment. When we have updates, we will let you know. For now, we ask that we all bow our heads in prayer. The J9 Foundation recently denied reports that Van der Westhuizen needed the additional oxygen to survive. Joost is still fighting strong he uses oxygen as a support occasionally and is by no means reliant on it the foundation said. What happens with MND is that the respiratory muscles become weak (as do all muscles) and due to this patients sometimes need oxygen support as the breaths are smaller, thus less oxygen going through the body. Oxygen support then just helps bring the levels up again when they feel they need it. Van der Westhuizen is recognised as one of the finest scrumhalves ever. He played in 89 Test matches for the Springboks and scored 38 tries. Independent Media
