For the last 16 years, Robben Island Museum and the Department of Home Affairs have partnered together to help couples, some from underprivileged backgrounds, say their &quot;I dos&quot; in one of Cape Town's most iconic tourist and historical venues. The couples will share the ceremony with their families. The senior manager for marketing and tourism at Robben Island Museum, Nomonde Ndlangisa, said this year coincided with the 20th anniversary of the museum. The Minister of the Department of Home Affairs, Malusi Gigaba, said in a press statement that they are proud to be a part of this initiative because of the significant role marriage played within communities and in building strong families. The statement read, As the Department of Home Affairs, we congratulate and wish the couples well on this new journey. Our authorised marriage officers will be dispatched to the island on the day to make this a happy experience for the couples and to also ensure that the marriages are officiated in accordance to our mandatory requirements. &quot;Participating couples have been chosen by the Department based on their diversity and interesting romantic stories.&quot; The couples arrived at the Nelson Mandela Gateway to catch the 8am ferry. The ceremony will commence from 9am at the Robben Island Chapel. Once the couples have exchanged their nuptials, they will enjoy their first lunch as husband and wife while enjoying the spectacular Cape Town vista view from Robben Island. The area will also be an opportunity for the couples to take their wedding photos on the beach and to capture the iconic and other scenic areas on the island. Guests will be serenaded by popular crooner Nur Abrahams at the reception.
