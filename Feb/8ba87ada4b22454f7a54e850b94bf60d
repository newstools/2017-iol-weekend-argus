Cape Town - A truck driver died on Friday afternoon after he lost control of his vehicle, which hit the side of the wall of a bridge near Kraaifontein. The truck caught fire with the man trapped inside. The driver had been travelling from Cape Town to Paarl when the truck veered off the road and hit the Exit 34 bridge in Joostenbergvlakte, Kenny Africa, provincial traffic chief, said last night. The driver was burnt beyond recognition, Africa said. Until 9pm Friday the N1 in Kraaifontein was closed, with traffic being directed through an off-ramp to Lucullus Road. Chris Botha, Netcare 911 spokesman, said paramedics responded to the collision shortly after 3pm. He said firemen were also on the scene to douse the flames. Weekend Argus
