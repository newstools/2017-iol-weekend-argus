Shahied Ajam s District Six Working Committee is engaged in painstakingly piecing together a record of the property deeds of the original 150ha precinct that was his childhood home. The process is complicated by the fact that some of the original erven have been consolidated under new erf numbers. Much of the area is grassy and vacant - but many parts have been developed since 1966.The Cape Peninsula University of Technology - built in the Zonnebloem of the Nationalists creation after the Group Areas Act declaration - is the largest property holder, occupying about 75ha, or half, of the original District Six. The committee says the city, province and insensitive landowners hold a further 22 percent or 33ha. The meagre 42ha, granted for restitution by the city in 2000, is the remaining 28 percent. We have lost 108ha, or 72 percent, and that is what we intend to claim back, as land or compensation, Ajam said.
