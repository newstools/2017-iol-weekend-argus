The use of a Drager breathalyser machine in charging and prosecuting alleged drunk drivers came under the spotlight again this week when an accused asked the court to order the prosecution to release information relating to the reading, the mechanics, operations and the software of the machine at the time of his arrest.The accused, who cannot be named because he is yet to plead, applied for the Cape Town Regional Court to order the release of additional information relating to the machine used to help him prepare for trial and cross-examination during trial, defence advocate Mornay Calitz said on Friday.According to court documents, the accused was stopped by police on the Bosmansdam off-ramp on the N7 in Milnerton in August and breathalysed. He was alleged to be over the permissible 0.24mg of alcohol per 1000ml.In its application, the defence asked for the National Prosecuting Guidelines for evidentiary breath-testing machines, the Drager Alcotest 9510 ZA operating instructions, certificate clarification of the method used to calibrate the machine, storage and maintenance records and documents relating to the training of the person operating the machine when the accused was tested.In his argument, Calitz referred to a 2011 high court matter where Joseph Hendricks, accused of the same offence, was acquitted because the court found that the State had failed to prove relevant elements of the offence, particularly with regards to the Drager breathalyser test. Calitz said depriving the defence of this information could subject the accused to an unfair trial. However, the State opposed the application, saying it was not in the interest of proper administration of justice but rather to obfuscate the issues .Senior state advocate Christenus van der Vijver said the accused had enough information to answer to the case against him. He said the the accused had been supplied with the charge sheet, a copy of the breath test results and the section of the docket with all relevant information, including witness statements.&nbsp;Weekend Argus
