Johannesburg The SABC s attempts to get Hlaudi Motsoeneng back have been dealt a blow after the Western Cape High Court dismissed the appeal application on Tuesday. The SABC had appealed the removal of Motsoeneng from the SABC and the matter was argued in the High Court last week. However, Motsoeneng would not be able to return to the SABC after Tuesday s ruling.Parliament had expressed surprise at the appeal, saying it was not aware and was unnecessary.The portfolio committee on communications had questioned the decision by SABC acting CEO James Aguma to appeal the judgment. Judge Owen Rodgers had granted the DA s application last November that Motsoeneng should not occupy any position at the SABC.This followed his appointment as Group Executive for Corporate Affairs after the Supreme Court of Appeal had thrown out his appointment as Chief Operating Officer. But the DA went to court again when Motsoeneng was appointed head of corporate affairs, and wanted the court to prevent his appointment to any position at the SABC. The court ruled in favour of the official opposition. Tuesday s ruling in the high court has put paid to any hopes that Motsoeneng would return to the public broadcaster soon, or any time in future.Political Bureau
