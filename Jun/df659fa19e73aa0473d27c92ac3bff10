Cape Town - The wounds&nbsp;from the ANC's 2015 provincial conference have not yet healed. This was the reason for attempts to disrupt a provincial executive committee (PEC) meeting at the weekend, according to ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs. He was speaking at a press conference to formally announce that the Dullah Omar region had been dissolved. The ANC provincial leadership blamed the regional leadership for the party's poor performance in the City of Cape Town where the DA received a two-thirds majority and the EFF ate into the ANC support, which resulted in 24% of the total votes. He said the Dullah Omar region only reached 6% of registered voters in the Cape Town metro, with Jacobs saying this was evidence that no work had been done in reaching out to voters. Our structures were weak and riddled with infighting and gatekeeping. &nbsp; On Sunday, leaders from five ANC regions, including Dullah Omar, called for the party's provincial executive to be disbanded, charging that it was factional and had ceased to function. Jacobs says the chaos, which preceded a decision to disband the party's biggest region, stemmed from fierce opposition to discuss the state of the organisation . ANC Dullah Omar regional secretary Xolani Sotashe said the decisions of the PEC meeting was invalid, as it did not meet the party's criteria for a quorum.&nbsp;The ANC constitution stipulates that 50%+1 of its members are required for a meeting to quorate.&nbsp; The Western Cape PEC has 40 members.
