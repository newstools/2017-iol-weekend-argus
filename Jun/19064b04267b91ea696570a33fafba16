FORD South Africa has announced another fire risk-related recall, this time on its entry-level Figos and Ikons, and the owners of 15 600 petrol-engined models have been emailed about immediately contacting a Ford dealership.These models were built in India between August 2004 and March 2012, and owners were asked on Wednesday to contact a dealership to replace the power steering high-pressure hose. Ford is voluntarily recalling these vehicles to replace the high pressure power-assisted steering hose, which may split, resulting in a power steering fluid leak, said Ford spokesperson Minesh Bhagaloo.The leak could result in fumes being emitted from the engine compartment. It may also be possible for power-steering fluid to come into contact with the vehicle s exhaust system components, creating the potential for smoke and, in extreme cases, fire. Globally 16 vehicles caught fire. However, none was in SA, according to Ford SA.Earlier this year, a Figo caught fire in Nelspruit. However, Ford said it was unsure whether the incident was directly related to issues related to the recall.Ford has faced a backlash in recent months after nearly 50 Kuga SUVs caught fire. In December 2015, Reshall Jimmy burnt to death when the Kuga he was driving caught alight.
