Despite her busy schedule as MC, voice-over artist, entrepreneur and part-time BCom student, the Cape Town beauty still makes time to participate in good causes. She recently took part in the first Female Celebrity Fight to raise awareness against bullying. “Our fighting, putting our bodies to the test, was a message to stand up to others or for others who are getting emotionally or physically abused,” she said. “We live in a world with a lot of wrong and a lot of bad but there is also good, so we need to stand up for others, stand up for yourself and don’t be hesitant to ask for help.” Hubner hopes for a country united in all respects. “The way I see it, we are all human. “Whether we have blonde hair, dark hair, purple hair, purple skin, light skin, dark skin, we are all the same. “I hope that one day everyone can look through the same eyes and see a person. I pray for a country that can provide warmth, shelter, water, food, equal opportunity and a dignified life for all.” For Hubner, Youth Day signifies bravery and a history of people coming together to fight for what is right. “The first thing to come to mind is the image of Mbuyisa Makhubo carrying Hector Pieterson,” she says of the famous image which has become the stark reminder of the tragic events of June 16, 1976. Asked what she would change given the power, Hubner says: “I would find a way to provide every man, woman and child with shelter, food, water and warmth. “Not having those things is just cruel, it’s inhumane. Nobody should suffer like that.”
