Cape Town The City of Cape Town says it can't guarantee the safety of water coming from underground springs and other sources. This is in response to queries about why a sign was put up at the Muizenberg spring discouraging people from drinking the water.A number of people collect drinking water from the Muizenberg spring, particularly as the Western Cape finds itself in midst of the worst drought in a century.&quot;Members of the public who use alternative water sources do it at their own risk,&quot; mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services and energy, Xanthea Limberg, said. &quot;These ground water, spring and urban stream sources do not form part of the City s formal water supply system and as such are not monitored and controlled to any drinking water standards.&quot; Zughdi Manuel, from Sherwood Park, wrote to the Cape Argus after he visited to spring to find the sign had been put up. Members of his family who live in Muizenberg have been collecting water from the spring and when he saw the sign, he was concerned. &quot;We needed clarity because many families use that point for getting water, when we saw the sign I wanted to find out.&quot; Limberg has urged residents to treat water from alternative sources before consuming.
