Cape Town – As the Western Cape Education Department continues to count the cost of the devastating storm, it has confirmed that at least 143 schools had been damaged. Some schools have been forced to close temporarily. Roofs and fences have been damaged and classrooms and administration buildings have suffered water damage. Inspectors were still assessing the overall damage. "Once we have received the reports on all schools, the total cost of damages and the extent of damages, we will determine the strategy going forward and the prioritisation of reparations works," Jessica Shelver, spokesperson for MEC Debbie Schäfer said. "Schools need to be made operational as soon as possible, which means that we will have to prioritise damages that affect the core functioning of the school, such as damage to classrooms, ablutions and administration blocks. It was too early to provide a timeframe for the repairs to be conducted, Shelver said, but the inspectors had already visited the worst-hit schools in the province. There were also contingency plans in place to accommodate the children affected in mobile classrooms. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

"A catch-up programme will be developed once alternative accommodation has been found," Shelver said. "The department will fix minor damages as soon as possible. Major repairs will take longer. These will need further investigation and procurement procedures. The districts are working closely with the schools to establish the best route forward." Despite the challenges, all pupils and teachers were expected to report to school as per usual.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
