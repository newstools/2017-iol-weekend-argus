His younger brother, Darshan Naidoo told POST the family is still reeling from shock after receiving the news.  It is believed David was involved in an accident with a truck.  "It all happened so suddenly, we were at a church event at The Embassy Church in Sherwood.  "Melvyn had written the script for the play. After church he had spent time with some friends, and had later left to drop off a family friend in Phoenix.  "Whilst returning to our home in Sherwood, we believe the accident occurred." He described his older brother as an icon.  "We have been inundated with calls from people sharing their messages of condolences or to find out if he is playing a bad joke on them.  "Also the social media posts has been over-whelming. It is evident that my brother was loved by many and that he will never be forgotten." Funeral arrangements will be announced soon.  Kumseela Naidoo, director at The Dingalings Production posted on Facebook: It is with the heaviest heart and greatest sadness that we face the news that our beautiful Melvyn Davids passed on in an accident this morning.  POST
