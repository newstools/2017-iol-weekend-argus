Johannesburg - Controversial Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma supporter Carl Niehaus has condemned his fellow comrades for “running to the court” after rulings on Friday excluded members of the party’s provincial executive from KwaZulu-Natal, the Free State and North West’s Bojanala region from participating in the ANC’s elective conference. Speaking on the sidelines of the conference which was supposed to start at 2pm, MKMVA spokesperson Carl Niehaus said party members had a responsibility to deal with things politically. “We believe quite strongly that ANC members have a responsibility to deal with politics, politically and not run to court.

He said a political organisation could not be ruled by court judgments.  “I am not convinced that the members of the ANC who have run to court have actually utilised all the opportunities and avenues that were available to them to be able to address these issues,” said Niehaus.
