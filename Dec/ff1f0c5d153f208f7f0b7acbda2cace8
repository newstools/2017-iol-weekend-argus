Johannesburg - Logistically, there are no plans to be here on December 21, ANC national spokesman Zizi Kodwa said on Sunday after the ANC's 54th national elective conference was delayed by about 20 hours. The conference, which is set to run from the December 16-20, got off to a delayed start on Saturday, mainly due to registration, but officially kicked with a final address from outgoing president Jacob Zuma. On Sunday, the credentials report was finally presented and adopted just before 12 pm, with 4776 delegates expected to vote for the new president of the ruling party. Credentials of delegates have to be adopted by the conference in order for voting of new leaders to proceed.

He added that the danger in rushing the agenda is that the court may come back and force the party to implement its own constitution. Kodwa said that despite the delays there were no plans to extend the conference. “It’s Christmas, people want to be with their families. Logistically, there are no plans to be here on the 21st,” he said.

Sunday’s programme will also include constitutional amendments, followed by nominations of the top six and then the organisational report, which will be presented by the party’s secretary-general. “Once it’s been presented, people can start voting and once they vote, you then announce the top six and then take nominations for the remaining National Executive Committee (NEC),” he said.
