5240 delegates will be voting on Saturday, of which 90% consists of branch delegates while the remaining 10% is made up of the women’s, youth and veterans' leagues, representatives from each provincial executive committee and the National Executive Committee. Each branch is allowed one delegate per hundred members. So branches with bigger memberships can send more than one delegate. KwaZulu-Natal, Mpumalanga and the Eastern Cape have the highest numbers of delegates.  PECs will be allowed 27 delegates per province while each league gets 60. Delegates are meant to vote with the mandate they received from their branches, even if it differs from their province's preferred candidate. After all the votes are in, counting will begin under the eyes of party observers and Independent Electoral Commission officials, while the rest of the conference continues debating and adopting the policies proposed at the party’s policy conference six months ago. The results will be announced once counting is completed, including of the top six and the rest of the National Executive Committee.  Weekend Argus
