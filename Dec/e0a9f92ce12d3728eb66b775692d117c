Cape Town - On Saturday 9 December 2017, the Weekend Argus ran a front-page story about the death of Shannen Rustin, a Westerford High School Grade 11 pupil, who collapsed and died while on a school trip in Vietnam. The reporter incorrectly used old information and referred to an earlier excursion on the school's website, which cited a previous school trip to Vietnam.  We would like to clarify that the pupils were NOT on a World Challenge expedition as incorrectly reported and that World Challenge was not involved in the organisation or operation of the trip whatsoever.  The trip was in fact organised by the head of the school's History department.  The Weekend Argus regrets the error and apologises to World Challenge, and any other effected party, for the inaccurate reporting and any inconvenience caused.
