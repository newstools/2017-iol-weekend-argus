Johannesburg - Snuki Zikalala, chairperson of the ANC Veterans League, told media at the Nasrec Convention Centre on Sunday that the league had met with Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma and were planning to meet with Cyril Ramaphosa to discuss the issue of unity with both presidential candidates.  "The economy has gone, there is mass unemployment, crime and we have to rebuild the ANC and build the country. "We will say to them whoever wins must make sure the ANC wins. We were injured after Polokwane but we think we can come out united after this conference." Zikalala said Sunday's discussion over the credential of voting delegates was crucial as only legitimate delegates were wanted at the conference.

"Come 2019 we may lose power and once we lose power we may never get it back again. The ANC is not corrupt but it is individuals in the party who are corrupt." Zikalala said President Jacob Zuma had been honest about the challenges facing the organisation. "He has to be honest. His speech was okay, it was conciliatory and he does not hold grudges." Zuma in his farewell speech as party president on Saturday said he wanted to join the Veterans League and continue to contribute to the ANC. Zikalala said Zuma would be treated like any other member and would have to fill in an application form and then he would have to be part and parcel of the ordinary  members.  IOL
