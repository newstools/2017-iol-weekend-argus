Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court has ruled that Parliament failed to hold President Jacob Zuma accountable for spending taxpayers' money upgrading his private Nkandla home. 'We conclude that the National Assembly did not hold the President to account as per the Constitution. It failed to perform its duty including its obligation to hold the President accountable,” Justice Chris Jafta said on Friday.

Friday's ruling places pressure on Parliament to act. In March last year, the Constitutional Court delivered a damning ruling in which it stated that Zuma had failed to “uphold, defend and respect the Constitution” when he did not adhere to the remedial actions called for by Madonsela.  Madonsela issued a report three years ago in which she stated that the millions that went into upgrading Zuma’s Nkandla homestead had not all been rightfully used. Madonsela found that Zuma had derived undue benefit from the security upgrades at his home with costs that ballooned to more than R200 million and eventually included a swimming pool, cattle kraal and amphitheatre, all added to Zuma’s home at taxpayer’s cost.
