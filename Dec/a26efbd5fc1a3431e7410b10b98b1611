The Sunday Tribune reported last week that Major-General Mandlenkosi Chirwa had been appointed to act as commander of Nunkumar’s cluster. A letter related to the alleged axing was signed by acting KwaZulu-Natal commissioner Major-General Bheki Langa. It stated Chirwa was appointed with immediate effect on December 21. The Sunday Tribune has seen the letter stating Nunkumar was dismissed on December 20 in terms of Regulation 12(1) (E) of the 2016 SAPS disciplinary regulations. This relates to regulation 5(3)(bb) which states that an employee will be guilty of misconduct if he or she performs any act or fails to perform any act with the intention of undermining service policy. The document was signed by Langa. Nunkumar, 53, was being investigated for alleged corruption, malpractice and maladministration.  The allegations surfaced in August last year when an SAPS officer queried Nunkumar’s dealings. Police spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker would not comment on the matter. A full list of the allegations were sent to Nunkumar but he had not responded by the time of going to print. SUNDAY TRIBUNE
