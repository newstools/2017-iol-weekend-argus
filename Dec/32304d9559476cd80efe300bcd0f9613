But the class of 2017 at Eerste-
rivier Secondary School have heeded the call of the principal and staff by donating their 
uniforms to those who need them. This year has been particularly trying for the school, after a Grade 11 pupil was stabbed to death on the premises by a fellow pupil. Acting deputy principal Wilburt Olivier said gangsterism in the area and at the school was rife. Through the school uniform donation initiative, the school  hoped to instil a form of pride and unity among the pupils. There are 1 178 pupils at the school, 171 in matric. Olivier said the initiative was started  last year, but had been slow to get going with few matric pupils donating their uniforms. He said there was a definite need for the initiative at the school as there were a number of children in need. The idea was discussed with the school staff and then with the matric pupils.  They were not initially keen, he said, however, he told them about the legacy they would leave.  On the last day of the matric exam, the response from the class of 2017 was overwhelming, he said.  The matrics brought their uniforms to school to offer them to those in need. “They left their uniforms on their desks and staff formed a guard of honour for them as they walked out of the school.” Teacher Arlene Talmarkes said they were overwhelmed by the commitment of the matrics. “When I saw this happening I realised that they do listen and the values are there.” Staff are sorting the uniforms and planning to open a school uniform bank.
