Johannesburg - The quest for radical economic transformation is being opposed as it challenges the economic status quo, outgoing African National Congress (ANC) President Jacob Zuma said on Saturday. “It is opposed because it challenges the current status quo. It seeks to transform the economy...we have to act decisively,” he told ANC delegates at the ruling party's elective national conference in Nasrec, Johannesburg, as he delivered his political report. Regarding land, Zuma said it should be redistributed accordingly. “We must redistribute land in an equitable manner while ensuring its productivity and food security. The ANC has made strides in the last five years through implementing policy and doing away with the willing-buyer-willing-seller system.” A land valuer general’s office has been established and two land audits carried out during his tenure, he added.
