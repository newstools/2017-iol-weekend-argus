Meghan Markle could be the first royal fiancée to spend Christmas with Queen Elizabeth after it was revealed the 'Suits' star is reportedly planning to spend the festive period with her fiancé Prince Harry and his family in the UK. The 'Suits' actress is reportedly planning to spend the festive period with her fiancé Prince Harry in the UK before the pair jet out to the United States to spend the New Year with her family. The royal family traditionally spend Christmas at Sandringham House in Norfolk, where they have a black-tie dinner, enjoy a full English breakfast and also go pheasant shooting. It comes after Prince Harry revealed he proposed to Meghan Markle during a "cosy night" in. She said: "It was a cosy night, we were roasting chicken ... and it was an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee." When asked if it was an immediate yes, Meghan added: "Yes! As a matter of fact, I could barely let [Harry] finish proposing." Whilst Prince Harry shared: "She didn't even let me finish. She said 'Can I say yes'. Then there were hugs and I had the ring in my finger. I was like ' Can I give you the ring?' It was a really nice moment. Just the two of us." Despite the pair only having dated for 16 months prior to their engagement, Meghan insists the relationship hasn't been a "whirlwind" as they had "five or six months" to get to know one another without being in the spotlight. The brunette beauty said: "I don't think that I would call it a whirlwind in terms of our relationship. There have been layers attached to how people it has become, after we had a good five, six months almost with just privacy, which was amazing.  "I think we were able to have so much time just to connect and we never went longer than two weeks without seeing each other even though we were obviously doing a long distance relationship. We made it work."
