Pretoria  -  Thanks to a Good Samaritan family, nine-year-old Michael Kgolane, who was born with deformed lower legs therefore unable to walk will soon have prosthetic limbs. It all started when the family was travelling in the Groblersdal area and saw Michael being pushed in a wheelbarrow by a group of young people.  When asked why and where the young boy was taken, they were told that he is being taken to friends because he is unable to walk. Touched by the response, the family decided to sacrifice their overseas trip and use the money to help Michael. They intended to fund his medical care as well as prosthetic limbs. “This family’s unbelievable kindness enabled Michael, who has never been able to walk, to undergo a successful surgery at the end of November to amputate his deformed lower legs and surgically shape the stumps in preparation for being fitted with prosthetic limbs fitted next year,” said Dr Mart-Mari Visser, the orthopaedic surgeon who performed the surgery. The ever smiling Michael is currently recovering from the surgery. Michael’s mother, Ditebogo Kglane said she will always be grateful and on behalf of her family, she expressed gratitude to the Good Samaritans as well as the people who have treated Michael. “The kindness of this family that has helped us has been unbelievable,” said Kglane.  “Up until now, Michael has had to get around our home on his knees, and we have had to use a wheelbarrow to get him to school and to see his friends, because we have not been able to afford a wheelchair." She said that once he gets the prosthetic legs, it will be the first time he will be able to walk.  IOL
