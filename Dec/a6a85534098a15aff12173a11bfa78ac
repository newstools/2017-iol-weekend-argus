Born Nkosinathi Innocent Maphumulo, Black Coffee will have five exclusive Friday night shows where he will entertain his fans to sounds from his latest gold-rated EP “The Journey Continues”.  Black Coffee’s residency will form part of Shimmy Beach Club’s annual Summer Calling campaign and is indeed a highlight on the establishment’s calendar, with last year’s shows sold out weeks in advance.  According to marketing manager, Brigette Willers, “the premier party venue balances the style of international party life and the laidback atmosphere of Cape Town, making it a stylish venue to rival Ibiza’s beach club scenes. This year, Black Coffee will be joined by a fresh line-up of local DJs on the decks, including Da Capo and Enoo Napo, contributing to what promises to be a big night out”.

Black Coffee said his fans can expect “a step up from last year, the best of Black Coffee yet. A mix of international sounds influenced by my world tour balanced with a touch of that local flavour”. Recognised as the most prominent electronic music producer in Africa, 2017 has seen the Durban-born DJ soar to greater heights. In September, he was awarded Best Deep House DJ at the 2017 DJ Awards, in Ibiza, for the second year in a row. The 2015 Award for Best Breakthrough DJ launched him to international acclaim and had him spinning his tribally infectious, vocal-laced beats everywhere from Coachella to Ultra Music Festival, ultimately earning him the prestigious spot of being the first-ever resident at Hï Ibiza, which is ranked in the top five of the International Nightlife Association’s World’s 100 Best Clubs. Added to his success, artists such as Jay-Z, Rihanna and Cassie have all requested he produce tracks for them this year. In July, he announced that he was the latest addition to the Beats 1 radio station family, joining the likes of DJ Khaled, Drake and Pharrell Williams, while his collaboration with Drake made headlines worldwide, when he was sampled on the Canadian rapper’s 2017 “playlist” More Life. Black Coffee added that he is “ready for anyone now, regardless of the genre” after famously turning down the chance to produce a track for Jay-Z earlier this year. “If I feel the song, that’s all that matters. I want to be known as a producer so I would never limit myself to a specific genre. For me it’s all about growth and learning,” he said. Yet perhaps what makes Black Coffee a South African icon is not just his music, talent or fame, but his humble nature. When taking to social media to thank fans for the continued support after winning his latest award, he wrote “One more for the culture. Thank you for the votes, love and continued support”.
