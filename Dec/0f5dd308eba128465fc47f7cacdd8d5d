Durban - Police are investigating an inquest after a woman and her 7-year old brother were killed when a boulder was allegedly thrown from a bridge over the N2 last night.  Amina Haffejee and her husband live in Johannesburg and were in Durban for a family holiday. A relative, who spoke to the Daily News last night, said Amina, her husband and her brother, Abdur Raheem Haffejee, were on their way from uMhlanga to Stanger when the boulder landed on the windscreen of the car.  The boulder landed on the passenger's side of the car, crushing Amina, who was in the front seat and Abdur Raheem, who was seated behind her.  Paul Herbst of IPSS Medical Rescue, said they received a phone call about the crash and responded immediately.  "While our response teams where on their way to the accident we received a second call saying that the driver was travelling towards a local hospital in Ballito, our teams rerouted towards the hospital and met up with the vehicle,” he said.  Both Amina and Adbul were declared dead on arrival at the hospital. Amina's husband was not injured.  There were only three people in the car at the time.  Police K9 units were deployed to the area where the boulder was thrown to search for possible suspects. However, no arrests have been made as yet. Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane, KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson, confirmed that an inquest has been opened at this stage.  "uMhlali police are investigating the matter. For now an inquest is under investigation to determine the cause of the deaths. If it is established that the boulder was in fact thrown by people, then it will be changed to two counts of murder," Zwane said.  Daily News
