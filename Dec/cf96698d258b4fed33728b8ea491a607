On Saturday, the contentious issue of the eligibility of some delegates to participate in the conference became the first hurdle on the first day.    Credentials of delegates have to be adopted by the conference in order for voting of new leaders to proceed. Vendors meanwhile, were again spotted setting up stalls with paraphernalia outside the venue. The conference was off to a slow start after proceedings were delayed for hours due to registration of delegates.
