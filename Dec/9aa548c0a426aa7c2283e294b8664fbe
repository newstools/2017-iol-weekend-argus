Cape Town - A 21-year-old man has been arrested for the brutal murder of Ismah Hill of Kalksteenfontein on Christmas Day.
The pretty 19-year-old had been dragged, her head covered in plastic bags, shot dead and her body dumped in a neigbour’s backyard. On Thursday, Ismah’s family expressed relief at the arrest, as they buried their their daughter according to Muslim rites. Relatives told the Daily Voice this week they believed the teenager’s ex-boyfriend, who is allegedly an Americans gangster, was behind her murder. Ismah had been enjoying Christmas festivities with friends when she was dragged away from the party. Her body was found in a backyard of a neighbour’s property in Hydrangea Street, Kalksteenfontein, in the early hours of Tuesday 26 December. She had a plastic bag over her head and had been shot.
