A few months ago fitness trainer Sbahle Mpisane and Kaizer Chiefs goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune sparked rumours that they were back together when Mpisane shared a picture of them together in Durban during her ‘umemulo’ - a traditional Zulu coming of age ceremony for women. The couple who broke up in 2016 may have taken their relationship to another level, according to Twitter Secret Service agents. A ring was spotted on Mpisane’s finger after she shared a picture on social media over the weekend sparking the engagement rumour.
