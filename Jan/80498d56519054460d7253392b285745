Cape Town Hundreds of women, men and children gathered outside the Iziko Museum in the Gardens, Cape Town on Saturday. The gathering formed part of a march in solidarity with the Women s March on Washington scheduled for later on Saturday. Representing diverse interest groups, from women s rights, gender equality, human dignity and civil liberties, the crowd gathered in a festive mood, determined to have their voices heard.&nbsp; The overall feeling was one of a desire to show support for the growing worldwide opposition to many of the proposed policies of the new Trump administration in the USA. Since the announcement of Trump s victory as the presidential candidate in America, there has been unprecedented opposition globally to his stance on many issues which could, if implemented, have the potential to undermine and threaten gains made in fulfilment of fundamental human rights to human dignity, equality and freedom. Possible restrictions of US foreign aid in the future, could also have a major impact on other parts of the world, especially the African continent. Groups representing American expats, women s workers organisations, gender equality groups and many other organisations gathered as one to hear the brief addresses and then march together in a show of defiance and support for the cause. It is hoped that the march in Washington will attract over one hundred thousand participants. After only 24 hours into his presidency, Trump has to live with the fact that he is already the most unpopular leader in American history. After the formal proceedings were completed, the march proceeded through the Gardens to the gates of Parliament, from where it dispersed. MOJOIOL
