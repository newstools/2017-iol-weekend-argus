Cape Town My last-born son, Nqobi Mbolo, 5, will start shaping his future when Western Cape schools re-open on Wednesday.He will be in Grade R, and if he does well, he will complete his final year in 2027.I have my concerns about all this. School means Nqobi will have more responsibilities, like homework and studying for tests. And it means I need to be hands-on and assist him with school work.He is a daddy s boy. He is outgoing, hyperactive and loves playing outside. He is also fond of toy cars. He loves his little life and enjoys playing with the neighbourhood kids.I have mixed feelings after I watched the national matric results on TV for the class of 2016. I think the country is putting too much pressure on these youngsters, with the result that some even decide to take their life if they don t make it. I think we need to stop applying this kind of pressure because it s killing our kids.I am scared of losing him to the street because he is going to be exposed to a lot of things at school like sex, drugs and bullies. These bullies will take chances because he will be a qhwetsa (newcomer).As a parent, the first grade classes are the ones that determine the destiny of a child, well before matric. But at the end of the day, he needs education.* Mbolo is a staff photographerWeekend Argus
