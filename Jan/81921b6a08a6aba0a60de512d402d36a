AT LEAST 60 people wearing T-shirts with images of baby Zahnia Woodward of Ocean View, who was killed last week, protested against bail for two murder accused at Simon s Town Magistrate s court yesterday.Six-month-old Zahnia was shot in Ocean View, on December 30, while sitting on her father Bradley Robyn s lap. They were with three of Robyn s friends, waiting for her mother, Cindy Woodward, to return from work. Baby Zahnia s supporters filled the seats in the gallery, while the two accused, Christopher September and Larry Johnson, made their way to the dock. The case was postponed to next month for a formal bail application.Outside court, Woodward said she had to hold back when she saw the two accused. She said was feeling messed up and Robyn was also not doing well. Neither of them have been for counselling, but they will be making a plan to seek counselling soon, she said.Woodward said she missed Zahnia and hadn t changed anything in the room since she died. She said she was not able to bring herself to wash some of Zahnia s clothes, as she did not want to wash away her smell.When asked if she would consider having more children after this tragedy, she said: I long for holding a baby in my arms. But she said she would plan more appropriately to provide a better future for any more children she might have. Melissa Tiemie, a family friend who came to support Woodward, said the two accused should not be given bail.Another supporter and friend, Edwina Kunn, said she was angry about the way the two accused looked at Robyn in court. They had no remorse. She said she would be at the next court appearance and they would oppose bail.
