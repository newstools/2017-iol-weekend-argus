The ANC in Nelson Mandela Bay plans to table a motion of no confidence against DA mayor Athol Trollip barely four months into his five- year term.The ANC wants council Speaker Jonathan Lawack removed as well.The party said the move to remove the DA leaders was gathering momentum as they were garnering other opposition parties in council for support.The motion of no confidence comes after a council meeting could not quorate because opposition parties apparently staged a walk-out from the council chambers at the Wool Board Exchange Building in Port Elizabeth this week.The meeting was called to table two reports on the termination of services of corporate services boss Mod Ndoyana, and the appointment of reputed administrator and businesswoman Vuyo Zitumane to act in the position.The UDM, which is part of the coalition governing the metro, and other parties failed to show up at the council meeting over their unhappiness regarding processes followed to appoint city manager Johann Mettler and Zitumane, among others. We will table our motion of no confidence during a council meeting on Monday.&quot;We are going to do that as a matter of urgency.&quot;Things are not looking good for the council, said ANC regional spokesperson Gift Ngqondi.Political Bureau
