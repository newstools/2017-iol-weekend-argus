Be proactive and save water. This is the message from the City of Cape Town as it moves to enforce level 3b water restrictions, which put severe limitations on water usage.Here are some water-wise tips: Invest in a grey-water system. Alje van Hoorn from Aquarista, a business which installs water-saving devices, said basic grey-water systems can be pricey and range between R15 000 and R24 000 for a fully installed system. There are less expensive systems on the market, but they become more difficult to maintain or use pumps that may not be as effective. A cheaper option is water tanks that collect rain water. Prices are from R1 500 for a 500-litre tank to about R12 000 for a 10 000-litre tank. Well points and boreholes can be used to keep gardens green and to flush toilets. Use grey water from baths, showers and washing machines to water gardens or flush toilets.The most cost-effective ways to collect grey water are: When running a shower place a bucket on the floor in the shower to collect water. Keep your bath water in the bath for the day and use a bucket to scoop out water to flush the toilet. Any leftover water can be used to water the garden. Many geysers have a pressure-reducing valve that will drip water through an outside pipe. Place a bucket under the pipe and use the water for flushing the toilet. Grey water should never be stored.Van Hoorn said another way to reduce consumption would be to partially close your municipal stop cock. This will cause a drop in pressure when water is used in the home. It works on the same principle as not opening your tap all the way - the water is restricted, causing a slower flow. This works for saving water when washing hands, showering and wetting toothpaste before brushing. Check for leaks at taps and toilets.Weekend Argus
