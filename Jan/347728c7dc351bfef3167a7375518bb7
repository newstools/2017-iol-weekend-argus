Top golfer Ernie Els may have unexpectedly found himself in the bunker this week, after he angered his fans with his remarks supporting US President Donald Trump.The former world No1 took to Twitter to congratulate Trump after his inauguration, tweeting: Congrats President Trump!!! Good Vibrations @realDonaldTrump. But within minutes, the South African was inundated with angry messages from his fans.Carolyn Baker tweeted: @The BigEasy @realDonaldTrump You ve just lost a fan, shame on you Els. It s no secret that Els and Trump enjoy a long-standing friendship. In fact, Trump sponsors Els autism charity foundation, the Ernie Els Foundation. George Owen tweeted: @TheBigEasy You got a golf course deal you want him to finance!!?? Shame on you! Last year, Trump was accused of mocking a disabled reporter from the New York Times. Els son, Ben, also suffers from autism. Derek Buie said: @TheBigEasy and you have a child with autism, and you congratulate the man who mocks the disabled. Brutal Ernie. Mark McDonald believed Els would regret backing Trump in the upcoming years. @TheBigEasy Ernie you will have flashbacks of apartheid in the coming years. The KKK supports him Ernie. I think * made a mistake.
