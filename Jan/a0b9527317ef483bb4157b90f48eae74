We believe de Lille had aspirations of becoming the premier of the Western Cape and we believe those aspirations have been halted by the bosses of the DA, ACDP provincial leader Ferlon Christians said.The EFF s Bernard Joseph added: It s quite clear there s trouble in the house of the DA. There appears to be a conflict of interest between the black members and the white members of the party, so, I don t buy De Lille s excuse. What we ll do is utilise this opportunity to make inroads come 2019. De Lille indicated her focus remained overseeing the roll-out of the Organisational Development and Transformation Plan.She explained the DA s constitution was set up that the provincial leader of the party was not an automatic candidate for premiership; that premiers were elected via internal electoral colleges.DA leader Mmusi Maimane s spokesperson Mabine Seabe on Monday called the premier succession talks premature discussions .Maimane, who has accepted De Lille s resignation, said as the most experienced mayor, De Lille will also focus on helping the DA govern well in our metros .Cape Argus
