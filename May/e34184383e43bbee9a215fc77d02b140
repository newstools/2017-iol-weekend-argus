Kwesta, who was 
snubbed at the Metro FM Awards, picked up the 
gongs for best male artist of the year, best rap album, highest airplay and best collaboration. Black won best newcomer, best female artist, best R&B/soul/reggae album and best album. These wins all come on the strength of her impressive debut album, Amazulu. Throughout the weekend, Sun City was abuzz with celebrities. The likes of hip hop royalty Khuli Chana, Kwesta and Stogie T performed in an evening which once again highlighted the genre’s domination of the local music industry. Nasty C, who was the most-nominated artist with five nominations, walked away empty handed. This came after his controversial domination of the Metros and his disqualification from the category of best video due to late entry. Apart from Black Motion, who have thus far dazzled audiences with their energetic performances, walked away with awards for best duo/group and best dance album. Other notable winners were Dr Malinga (best kwaito album), Vusi Nova (best Afro pop album) and GoodLuck (best pop album). Nhlanhla Sibisi, chief executive of RiSA, the company which organises the awards, said earlier in the week: “It promises to be magic. It will be lit. You cannot afford to miss what the creative team has put together to show off just what South African music is all about.” The show lived up to his high expectations. An excited Sibisi said: “We applaud all the winners and nominees and the music-loving South Africans who have supported these awards. We are encouraged by the generosity of our sponsors and all stakeholders, media included, in this great project. South African music can only grow from here.”
