The e-mails show the extent of Gupta control over cabinet ministers and parastatal CEOs and board members, the Sunday Times reported. The correspondence also gives insight into the role of President Jacob Zuma’s son Duduzane in presidential matters. Duduzane is a close Gupta associate and is believed to have made billions through this partnership, the newspaper said. Another series of explosive e-mails show that the Guptas were central to a scheme for Zuma and his family to acquire residency in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. However, Zuma on Saturday denied the claim, saying his only home was in Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal. Along with Gupta brothers Ajay, Atul, and Tony, Sahara CEO Ashu Chawla emerges as a key player in the intricate web of state capture, the Sunday Times reported. The e-mails revealed, among other things, that the Guptas were sent Mosebenzi Zwane’s CV a month before he was appointed minister of mineral resources; intervened to have the powers of the then communications minister Faith Muthambi strengthened and were forwarded a presidential proclamation detailing her powers by Muthambi herself before it was signed by Zuma; and received confidential information on cabinet meetings from Muthambi, the Sunday Times said. In a similar story, the City Press reported that an email trail between the controversial Gupta family and their employees had blown the lid off how they managed to do business with government, ingratiate themselves with senior officials, and go so far as to help move Zuma and his family to Dubai.
