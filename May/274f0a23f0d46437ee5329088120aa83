She is made to order and can be customised. Recently, Abyss Creations, the US company behind the world-famous RealDoll, released Harmony AI, an app with a “brain” to help your silicone RealDoll cater to your every whim. The AI app is the precursor to Abyss’s future female “sex-bots”, also known as gynoids. Abyss chief executive Matt McMullen told Future Of Sex that the app’s foundation is genderless - once “the male version of the app is complete, subscribers will be able to easily choose different genders when creating their AIs”, he said. Relationship expert Kas Naidoo thinks the development of personal sex robots spells disaster. “We already have fewer conversations where we can actually see the expression on a loved one’s face or hear the emotion in their voice,” she said. “A doll is certainly not going to love you back; it’s not going to appreciate you in the way we all crave.”
